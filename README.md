Azure AI Content Safety is an AI service that detects harmful user-generated and AI-generated content in applications and services. Azure AI Content Safety includes text and image APIs that allow you to detect material that is harmful. The interactive Content Safety Studio allows you to view, explore, and try out sample code for detecting harmful content across different modalities.
